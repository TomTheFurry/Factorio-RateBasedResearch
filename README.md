# Factorio-RateBasedResearch
A mod actively in development for factorio that adds decays to research

# Dev Environment setup
This repo uses Visual Studio Code, along with justarandomgeek's Factorio Modding Tool Kit extension.
To set up the environment, clone the repo and run the `factorio: Select version` pointing it towards your installation of factorio. That should generate an untracked file `.vscode/settings.json` storing that configuration.
This should be all you need to set it up and running with debuggers and etc.
